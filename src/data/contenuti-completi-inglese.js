          "titolo": "William Wordsworth and the Lake Poets",
          "riassunto": "William Wordsworth (1770-1850) was a leading English Romantic poet and founder of the Lake Poets, who lived in the Lake District of Cumberland. His collaboration with Samuel Taylor Coleridge produced Lyrical Ballads (1798), which became the manifesto of English Romanticism. The 1800 Preface outlined his revolutionary poetic theory: poetry should be the 'spontaneous overflow of powerful feelings recollected in tranquility,' using common language instead of neoclassical artificiality, with subjects drawn from everyday life and humble nature. Nature was central to his philosophy - not mere backdrop but a living spiritual presence embodying pantheistic divinity. Childhood represented paradise lost, an innocent pure vision corrupted by society's growth. Memory and recollection recreated past emotions in poetry. Major works include Tintern Abbey (1798), a return to a beloved place where nature acts as moral and spiritual teacher; The Prelude (1805, published 1850), a poetic autobiography of the poet's formation; Daffodils (I Wandered Lonely as a Cloud), celebrating golden dancing daffodils by the lake; and the Lucy poems cycle about a girl, nature and death. Themes include nature as moral teacher, creative memory and imagination, childhood as state of grace, simplicity of language, and spontaneous emotion versus artificiality. Samuel Taylor Coleridge (1772-1834) was his friend and collaborator, famous for Rime of the Ancient Mariner and the visionary fragment Kubla Khan.",

          "titolo": "Lord Byron and Percy Shelley: Rebellion and Idealism",
          "riassunto": "George Gordon, Lord Byron (1788-1824) was a rebellious Romantic poet and scandalous embodiment of the Byronic hero. His adventurous life included noble birth, physical lameness, scandalous love affairs (including with his half-sister), exile from England in 1816, and death from fever in Missolonghi in 1824 while fighting for Greek independence. The Byronic hero is a proud, solitary, cursed rebel against society with violent passions, magnetic charm, inner torment, and mysterious guilty past. Major works include Childe Harold's Pilgrimage (1812-1818), an autobiographical journey of a disillusioned young man through Europe, and Don Juan (1819-1824), an unfinished epic satirical poem. Percy Bysshe Shelley (1792-1822) was an idealist, radical, and atheist poet. Expelled from Oxford for atheism, he eloped with Mary Godwin (author of Frankenstein) and drowned in a storm off the Italian coast aged 30. His political and social idealism championed justice, equality, and freedom, opposing tyranny and oppressive religion. He saw the poet as prophet and unacknowledged legislator transforming the world through poetry. Major works include Ozymandias (1818), a sonnet on the vanity of power; Ode to the West Wind (1819), using the west wind as symbol of change and revolution; To a Skylark, with the bird as symbol of pure joyous poetry; and Prometheus Unbound, about liberation from tyranny. Themes include political freedom, atheism, free love, sublime power of nature, and the visionary poet.",

          "titolo": "John Keats: Beauty and Mortality",
          "riassunto": "John Keats (1795-1821) was a Romantic poet who died tragically young of tuberculosis at 25, yet produced some of the finest poetry in English literature. Born into a lower-middle-class family, he trained as an apothecary before dedicating himself to poetry. His brief but intense career was marked by financial difficulties, harsh criticism, and unrequited love for Fanny Brawne. His philosophy centered on 'negative capability' - the ability to remain in uncertainty and doubt without irritably reaching after fact and reason. Beauty and truth were synonymous in his aesthetic philosophy. Major works include the Great Odes: Ode to a Nightingale (1819), contrasting the immortal bird's song with human mortality; Ode on a Grecian Urn (1819), exploring art's permanence versus life's transience with the famous line 'Beauty is truth, truth beauty'; Ode to Autumn (1819), celebrating the season's richness; and La Belle Dame sans Merci, a haunting ballad of fatal love. His letters reveal a brilliant critical mind discussing poetry and imagination. Themes include the conflict between ideal and real, beauty and mortality, permanence and transience, and the power of imagination. His sensuous imagery and musical language influenced later poets significantly.",

          "titolo": "Charles Dickens: Social Criticism and Urban Life",
          "riassunto": "Charles Dickens (1812-1870) was the greatest novelist of the Victorian age and a powerful social critic. His difficult childhood, with his father imprisoned for debt and himself working in a blacking factory at age 12, profoundly influenced his lifelong concern for social justice and the plight of the poor. He became a journalist and achieved fame with The Pickwick Papers (1836-37). His novels combine entertainment with serious social criticism of industrial capitalism, urban poverty, and class inequality. Major works include Oliver Twist (1838), exposing the harsh treatment of orphans and workhouse conditions; David Copperfield (1850), his most autobiographical novel; Bleak House (1853), criticizing the legal system; Hard Times (1854), attacking utilitarian education and industrial dehumanization; Great Expectations (1861), exploring social mobility and moral growth; and A Christmas Carol (1843), promoting Christian charity and social responsibility. His characters are memorable and often symbolic, from the innocent Oliver to the miserly Scrooge. Themes include social injustice, the corruption of innocence, the power of love and kindness, and faith in human goodness despite social evils. His style features vivid descriptions of London, humor mixed with pathos, melodramatic plots, and a strong narrative voice advocating for social reform.",

          "titolo": "Charlotte and Emily Brontë: Gothic Romance and Passion",
          "riassunto": "The Brontë sisters, Charlotte (1816-1855) and Emily (1818-1848), were pioneering female novelists who challenged Victorian conventions about women's roles and sexuality. Growing up in isolated Haworth parsonage on the Yorkshire moors, they created imaginary worlds in childhood that influenced their mature fiction. Charlotte Brontë's Jane Eyre (1847) revolutionized the novel with its first-person female narrator who asserts her independence and equality. Jane, an orphaned governess, falls in love with her brooding employer Mr. Rochester, but discovers his dark secret - a mad wife hidden in the attic. The novel combines Gothic elements with social criticism, exploring themes of class, gender, religion, and female autonomy. Emily Brontë's Wuthering Heights (1847) is a dark, passionate tale of destructive love between Heathcliff and Catherine Earnshaw. Set on the Yorkshire moors, it uses a complex narrative structure and explores themes of revenge, social class, and the supernatural. The novel was initially criticized for its violence and unconventional morality but is now considered a masterpiece. Both novels feature strong, independent heroines who challenge social expectations, Gothic atmospheres with mysterious houses and dark secrets, and passionate love that transcends social boundaries. The sisters' work influenced later feminist literature and established the tradition of the female Gothic novel.",

          "titolo": "Oscar Wilde: Aestheticism and Decadence",
          "riassunto": "Oscar Wilde (1854-1900) was an Irish writer, playwright, and leading figure of the Aesthetic movement. Born in Dublin to intellectual parents, he excelled at Trinity College and Oxford, where he was influenced by Walter Pater's aestheticism. In London, he became famous as a brilliant wit and conversationalist, advocating 'art for art's sake' and living life as a work of art. His marriage to Constance Lloyd and two children couldn't suppress his homosexual nature, and his relationship with Lord Alfred Douglas led to his downfall. Convicted of 'gross indecency' under Victorian anti-homosexuality laws, he served two years hard labor in Reading Gaol, then died in exile in Paris aged 46. His only novel, The Picture of Dorian Gray (1890), tells of a beautiful young man whose portrait ages while he remains young, exploring themes of beauty, corruption, and the consequences of hedonism. His plays include Lady Windermere's Fan (1892), A Woman of No Importance (1893), An Ideal Husband (1895), and his masterpiece The Importance of Being Earnest (1895), a brilliant comedy of manners satirizing Victorian society. His aesthetic philosophy emphasized beauty over morality, art's independence from social utility, and the artist's superiority to conventional society. His wit produced memorable epigrams like 'I can resist everything except temptation' and 'We are all in the gutter, but some of us are looking at the stars.' Prison writings include De Profundis (1905) and The Ballad of Reading Gaol (1898).",

          "titolo": "Robert Louis Stevenson: Adventure and Psychology",
          "riassunto": "Robert Louis Stevenson (1850-1894) was a Scottish novelist, poet, and travel writer who combined adventure stories with psychological insight. Born in Edinburgh to a family of lighthouse engineers, he rebelled against his Presbyterian upbringing and studied law before turning to writing. Poor health led him to travel extensively, seeking better climates, and he eventually settled in Samoa where he died aged 44. His masterpiece, The Strange Case of Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde (1886), is a psychological thriller exploring the duality of human nature. Dr. Jekyll's experiments to separate his good and evil sides create the monstrous Mr. Hyde, representing Victorian anxieties about respectability and hidden desires. The novella uses London's fog-bound streets to create a Gothic atmosphere and explores themes of scientific responsibility, moral duality, and the thin line between civilization and savagery. Treasure Island (1883) revolutionized children's literature with its vivid adventure story of young Jim Hawkins and the pirate Long John Silver. The novel combines coming-of-age themes with exciting plot and memorable characters. Kidnapped (1886) draws on Scottish history and landscape. His essays and travel writing, including Travels with a Donkey in the Cévennes (1879), show his skill in descriptive prose. Themes include the conflict between duty and desire, the complexity of human nature, and the appeal of adventure and exotic places.",

          "titolo": "Joseph Conrad: Imperialism and the Human Heart",
          "riassunto": "Joseph Conrad (1857-1924) was a Polish-born British novelist who wrote in English as his third language, creating some of the finest prose in English literature. Born Józef Teodor Konrad Korzeniowski, he spent twenty years as a merchant seaman before becoming a writer at age 37. His maritime experiences and travels to Africa and the Far East provided material for his fiction. Heart of Darkness (1899) is his masterpiece, narrating Marlow's journey up the Congo River to find the mysterious Kurtz, an ivory trader who has 'gone native.' The novella critiques European imperialism in Africa, exposing the brutality and hypocrisy of the 'civilizing mission' while exploring themes of moral corruption, the thin veneer of civilization, and the darkness within human nature. The famous phrase 'the horror! the horror!' captures Kurtz's final recognition of evil. Lord Jim (1900) tells of a young seaman who abandons a ship full of pilgrims and spends his life trying to redeem himself. Nostromo (1904) is an epic novel set in the fictional South American republic of Costaguana, exploring political corruption and the destructive power of material interests. Conrad's style features complex narrative structures, multiple narrators, impressionistic techniques, and philosophical depth. His themes include the isolation of individuals, the corruption of idealism, the clash between Western and non-Western cultures, and the moral ambiguity of human actions.",

          "titolo": "Thomas Hardy: Fate and Rural England",
          "riassunto": "Thomas Hardy (1840-1928) was an English novelist and poet whose work bridges the Victorian and modern periods. Born in rural Dorset, he trained as an architect before turning to writing. His novels are set in 'Wessex,' a fictionalized version of southwestern England, and chronicle the decline of rural life in the face of industrialization and social change. His philosophy was deeply pessimistic, influenced by Darwin's theories and his loss of religious faith. He saw humans as victims of fate, chance, and social forces beyond their control. Tess of the d'Urbervilles (1891) tells the tragic story of a pure woman destroyed by male exploitation and social hypocrisy. Tess is seduced by Alec d'Urberville, abandoned by her husband Angel Clare when she confesses her past, and finally hangs for murdering Alec. The novel attacks Victorian sexual double standards and class prejudice. Jude the Obscure (1895) follows the tragic life of Jude Fawley, a stonemason who dreams of university education but is thwarted by class barriers and an unhappy marriage. The novel's frank treatment of sexuality and criticism of marriage and religion caused scandal. The Mayor of Casterbridge (1886) depicts the rise and fall of Michael Henchard, whose character flaws lead to his destruction. Hardy's style combines realistic detail with symbolic landscapes, where nature often reflects human emotions. His themes include the conflict between individual desires and social constraints, the power of the past to shape the present, and the indifference of fate to human suffering.",

          "riassunto": "Wilfred Owen (1893-1918) and Siegfried Sassoon (1886-1967) were the greatest poets of World War I, transforming how war was portrayed in literature. Owen, killed just one week before the Armistice, wrote poetry that exposed the brutal reality of trench warfare, contradicting the patriotic propaganda of the time. His famous poem 'Dulce et Decorum Est' describes a gas attack and concludes that it is a lie to tell children that it is sweet and fitting to die for one's country. 'Anthem for Doomed Youth' compares the deaths of soldiers to a funeral service, asking 'What passing-bells for these who die as cattle?' His technique combined traditional forms with innovative sound effects, using alliteration, assonance, and half-rhymes to create the sounds of war. Sassoon, who survived the war, began as a patriotic volunteer but became a fierce critic of the war's conduct. His poetry attacks the incompetence of military leaders and the complacency of civilians. 'The General' satirizes military incompetence, while 'Glory of Women' criticizes women's romantic view of war. Both poets met at Craiglockhart Hospital where they were treated for shell shock, and Sassoon encouraged Owen's poetry. Their work established a new tradition of anti-war literature, emphasizing the waste of young life, the horror of modern warfare, and the gap between official propaganda and soldiers' experiences. Themes include the pity of war, the loss of innocence, the failure of traditional values, and the psychological trauma of combat.",
